Lessons Learned Report

Project Name: EasyPrep AI
Project Managers: Olivia, Sonata, Malachi White 
Project Sponsor: Vanessa Coote 
Prepared by: Malachi White 
Date prepared:12/1/2023

 
Project Objective:
	Easy Prep-AI aims to create an application that will reduce the amount of food people   waste and keep track of the amount of food they currently have. In Easy Prep, AI will have a feature that will allow users to share their recipes, and with the power of AI, Easy Prep will create recipes based on the food you already have. Throughout this semester, the goal was to plan, design, and architect a plan of action before coding a full-scale application.


What went well in the project.
The thing that the team did well in the project was the ability to collaborate effectively. We came up with good strategies on how to accomplish our milestone goals. We also made sure to utilize the strengths of each team member for faster and better results.


What issues did the project team encounter? 
Our team’s main issue was the workload; we lost one of our team members. So, each one of us had a little more extra to do. This became more challenging as time passed because each milestone increased in complexity.

	
What should we continue to do which helped this project be successful? 
Our team should continue to have a meeting’s and a good line of communication. 


What could we improve? 
The main area of improvement is needed in our organization and our scheduling. We had sold communication but we could have structured it better for more effectiveness. 



What were barriers to the success of this project, if any? 
In our team’s opinion, we exceeded our expectations for the project; we didn’t come across anything that made us feel we could not complete the project. Our team did great in delivering all aspects of the project.
