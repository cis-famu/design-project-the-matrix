## Research on other systems
Easy Prep is a food application relying heavily on AI and ML. To be able to create good recipes and safe food for anyone who uses the app. However, to understand how the system works and the design that the app aims to accomplish, several other applications make Easy Prep more feasible. “Hey Siri,” the famous Apple personal assistant, uses AI and ML technology to recognize the voice of the users and determine if the user’s voice was detected based on a score in the algorithm. If the score is high enough, “Hey Siri” will speak. This specific function has nothing to do with Easy Prep initially, but the underlying functionality does. The “Hey Siri” feature uses a scoring system to rate whether the user who spoke clearly and correctly said those specific words and scored it through its algorithm. Easy Prep will need the same functionality to give users accurate recipes so that they can create something tasty, and edible based on their food needs and diet. 

This leads perfectly to the next system that gives Easy Prep more clarity, the Tesla self-driving car system. This system focuses more on the ML aspect of it, where the car needs lots of data to make accurate and safe decisions for drivers. Tesla uses large data models to predict and enhance user driving experience. Because of the data the car receives, they can make split-second decisions based on the sensors and monitors in the vehicle. Easy Prep will need similar match-making ML algorithms to match foods correctly based on the food users scan into the application. With these two systems running in Easy Prep, it can score the food the user puts into the application. The application data sets and algorithms can compare the food to a wide range of images and recipes to accurately produce what foods the user can make based on what they scanned in.

## API Descriptions


Dalle API – Image 
The Dalle Api is the API that was created from Open AI. It is an image generator API that makes images based on text prompts. But for Easy Prep AI, we would pass in the scanned meal information to the text prompt, allowing pictures of the food that can be created to show the generated food that could be made.

Spoonacular API – Recipes 
It is a food recipe API that can search different recipes, nutrients, ingredients, etc., for food you can create. This API will be used for recipes in the backend of our application, and it will help ensure that the food that users are scanning is edible.

Open Food Facts API- Food Information 
This is the world's most extensive open food API, with contributions since 2012. It has a comprehensive database of all listed grocery store foods worldwide. Having this API will allow Easy Prep access to almost any food worldwide. It will also be able to give each breakdown of the food if asked for it by the user. Such as Calorie amount, and other nutritional information that may be important to the user.
