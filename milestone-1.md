 Project Scope Statement
Project Purpose / Business Justification Describe the business need this project addresses
Give people the chance to effectilvy save food and money by creating new and pre excisting recipes through AI with the food that they already have. This allternative food recipe generater will help elimate with food waste by at least 12% through cost saving methods and reduce food cost by 40%. 
Objectives (in business terms) Describe the measurable outcomes of the project, e.g., reduce cost by xxxx or increase quality to yyyy
The outcomes are to reduce the overall cost of the amount of food people purchose (averge cost of groceries is $250), and waste when they go to the super market. 
Deliverables List the high-level “products” to be created (e.g., improved xxxx process, employee manual on yyyy)
The Food Prep AI App, Prototype, API Description to improve the overall number of food recipes, WBS, Use Case Diagram, Data Dictionary, Detailed Requirements Documents, Interactive Wireframe, Risk Register. 



Scope List what the project will and will not address (e.g., this project addresses units that report into the Office of Executive Vice President.  Units that report into the Provosts Office are not included)  
This project will address the amount of food that someone has in the house, the cost of the food, and the AI genertated recipes. The app will address dietary restrictions nad give healthy options based on the food you have.The project will not address food disscounting, a paywall and where to locate the food that you would like to purchase.

Project Milestones Propose start and end dates for Project Phases (e.g., Inception, Planning, Construction, Delivery) and other major milestones
Miles Stone 1: October 1 – Project Planning 
Mile Stone 2 : October 22 - Budget
MileStone 3: November 19 – Interface Desgin 
MileStone 4: December 10 – Data desgin and risk management 

Major Known Risks (including significant Assumptions) Identify obstacles that may cause the project to fail.   
Risk 	Risk Rating (Hi, Med, Lo)
Accessable data sets 	Lo
Funding 	Med
Complexity 	High

Constraints List any conditions that may limit the project team’s options with respect to resources, personnel, or schedule (e.g., predetermined budget or project end date, limit on number of staff that may be assigned to the project).
Some of the constraints on the project that we may come across are the ability to manage the teams time, with other extra collective activites that other’s have. Our predetermind bugdet does not allow for large changes in the amount of spending that we may incur while structuring and building our system, so it may need to be widened. 

External Dependencies Will project success depend on coordination of efforts between the project team and one or more other individuals or groups? Has everyone involved agreed to this interaction?
Everyone in the project is in alignment with what need to be done to be succesful in the project. There are no outside dependecies for the group that anyone is relying on. 

Communication Strategy (specify how the project manager will communicate to the Executive Sponsor, Project Team members and Stakeholders, e.g., frequency of status reports, frequency of Project Team meetings, etc.
Zoom, FaceTime, Microsoft Teams and Canvas. Team meeting’s are held twice a week with a weekly sprint review that is every Monday to see what we need to accomplish for the week, with status report will be done every 2 weeks for status updates and issues coming along with the project.

## SWOT Analysis:

Strengths: 
1. AI generated recipes can save users time by providing quick and efficient meal planning.
2. This AI can allow personal recommendation based on user preference, dietary restrictions, and ingredient availability. 

Weaknesses: 
1. Developing and maintaining the AI algorithms for recipe generation may require significant technical expertise and resources.
2. The AI may limit culinary creativity when replicating unique and innovating recipes

Opportunity: 
1. Addressing the global issue of food waste presents an opportunity for significant impact and recognition.
2. AI technology is currently trending and can provide an advantage towards technological advancement and give us potential collaboration opportunities.

Threats: 
1. The potential risk of financial challenges such as underfunding
2. Prep Easy AI could face competition from other food/tech start-ups or companies that are already in the market
